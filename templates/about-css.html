   <h1>About Sean Clark</h1>

<p id="bigger">My name is Sean Clark I am 22 years old and I am a senior information systems major at the University of Maryland's Robert H. Smith School of Business.
I am currently finishing up my last semester at UMD where I am taking project management, business law, and information systems projects. I am excited about what the future has in store for me </p>


    <h2>Sean's Favorite Hobbies</h2>

<p id="bigger">Some of my favorite hobbies include playing sports with my friends, watching NFL on sundays, and playing video games. I grew up playing sports like baseball my entire life
, so its just something that I love to do whenever the weather is nice outside. My favorite NFL team is the New York Jets so I like to keep up with them each week. I also grew up
playing video games like GTA and Call of Duty with my cousins so every now and then I like to play it during my down time.</p>

    </ul>
   <p id="para3"> Out of this list of sports teams the team I am most passionate about is the New York Jets. I became a Jets fan when I was 9 years old because my favorite player laDainian Tomlinson went there
   in free agency and ever since then I have been enamored with the team even though we have struggled to win games throughout most of my life.</p>
